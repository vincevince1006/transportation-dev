<h2>On the Bus</h2>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> My child is in the “Walk Zone,” but the walk to school is not safe. Who should I speak to about that?</h3>
  <p class="faq-text">If you believe that the walk-zone is unsafe, express your concern to the Transportation Area Manager of that school.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> Why are the seats so close together? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text">It’s all for safety purposes. The seats were re-designed to specific spacing, with full padding front and back, and increased back height for maximum impact protection. The newer designed seats provide a padded cavity for passenger compartmentalization. Crash tests prove this to be the most effective protection on impact.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> Why are the 39’’ seats on school buses said to fit three children when they will only fit two? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text">The rated capacity of a 39” width passenger seat was devised many years ago. In determining seating capacity on a bus, an allowable average width standard was established. Accordingly, 13” was suggested with three students per seat (three students if elementary; for middle and high school students, loads are adjusted). </p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> What if my child’s bus is over crowded? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text">Contact the Transportation office and ask that your call be referred to the manager for your child’s bus.  A bus that has three elementary students to a seat or two middle or high school students to a seat may seem crowded.  However, it will not be over capacity.  Our goal is to fully utilize all of the space on all buses in our fleet.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> Why aren’t there seat belts on buses? Are they safe? </h3>

  <p class="faq-text">Our buses are held to the highest standards of construction to provide the safest method to transport our children. School bus transportation is the safest form of travel in the United States with over 24 million students transported daily nationwide on 450,000 buses traveling over 4.3 billion miles per year. Over a 10-year period, only one third of 1 percent of all fatal crashes involved a student on a school bus. School bus safety is based on closely spaced and padded seats on a large framed vehicle, as mandated by Federal Law. The State of Maryland has additional requirements, including a limit on the life of the vehicle. National Traffic Highway Safety Administration tests have shown that lap belts only (which is what New York, New Jersey, and Florida have on their buses) would result in more fatalities and/or injuries than they would save. Usually, when a fatality occurs on a school bus, it is when another large vehicle (dump truck, tractor trailer, or train) collides with a school bus, and the victim is sitting at the point of impact. National statistics indicate that your child is 63 times safer inside the school bus than in your car.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> Can all my kids/ my kids friends sit together on the bus?</h3>
  <p class="faq-text">Yes, it is sometimes possible. If the children are in line together, they have a greater chance of finding seats together or near each other.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> Does the bus driver assign seats? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text">The bus driver may assign seats as he/she feels necessary to maintain order and safety on the bus.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> Can my child bring musical instruments, school projects, or other large items with them on the bus?</h3> 

  <p class="faq-text">Musical Instruments and large objects are permitted on the school bus as long as the student can carry an instrument or object on and off of the bus by him/herself. They must be placed in the student's lap or stored between the student's legs and the barrier in front of the student. Instruments or large objects cannot block the aisle. Large instruments such as drum-kits, cellos and basses are too large to be transported safely on school buses. In an accident, these items can easily become a projectile and can injure a student. If you are unsure, please check with your child's school before bringing a large musical instrument or object to the bus stop.</p>

<h2>Bullying and Misbehavior</h2>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> Who should I call to report problems on my child’s bus? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text">If the problem pertains to the behavior of students, please contact the school that your child attends. If the problem pertains to the driver, please contact the Transportation office at: 410-313-6732</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> My child has been bullied on the bus. What can I do? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text">HCPSS has a policy that specifically prohibits "bullying" at school, during school events and field trips and on a school bus. The bus driver's main focus must be on operating the school bus safely. As a result, the majority of the driver's attention is focused on the road and traffic conditions, so he/she may not see or hear inappropriate behavior among the students on the bus when it occurs. However, we now have four cameras on each of our school buses, which will allow us to monitor student behavior and to reduce any bullying that may occur by dealing with it swiftly and objectively. Students who engage in bullying or harassing behaviors are subject to disciplinary action. Please report any problems to your child's school so that appropriate steps may be taken. </p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> My child has misbehaved on the bus. Does the bus driver have the right to discipline him/her? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text">The school bus driver (or attendant) is responsible for the safe operation of the bus. He/she should receive the same level of respect afforded to a classroom teacher, assistant or other school employee. When necessary, drivers or attendants may correct a student. In most cases, that resolves the problem. If the misconduct continues, the driver may complete a "bus conduct report" to notify the school of the event for further review and, if appropriate, disciplinary action.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> What’s a “bus conduct report”?</h3>
  <p class="faq-text">A bus conduct report is used to report a student whose violation of safety rules on the bus may cause harm to the student, to another student or to the public. This includes actions that distract the bus driver's attention from the roadway. If a bus conduct report is completed for a student, the school staff members will contact the student's family if they need to speak to the parent or guardian as part of the disciplinary steps taken to resolve the problem.</p>

<h2>Drivers</h2>
<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> I don’t like my child’s bus driver. Can I request a different one? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text">Bus drivers and attendants are professionally trained and supervised. We do not remove staff from routes without an investigation in accordance with our personnel policies and procedures. If you have a concern, please call the Office of Pupil Transportation at 410-313-6732.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> My child and I really liked one driver, but they were reassigned to a different route. Could we get the driver back? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text">We both recognize and appreciate that students often bond and develop relationships with staff, and we try to have drivers and attendants remain on the same routes for extended periods of time. However, in some cases, drivers or attendants may be transferred to other routes. </p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> I witnessed an issue with a bus drivers driving. How can I report this to the HCPSS? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text">Please make a note of the location and time of the incident and, most important, the bus number, posted on the side, front and rear of the vehicle. Call 410-313-6726 and ask for a Supervisor.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> What kind of process do the drivers go through to make sure they are qualified and safe to be around children?</h3>
  <p class="faq-text">In short, applicants must have a Commercial Drivers License, they must be fingerprinted, criminal background checks are done, driving records are examined, references are checked, drug/alcohol tests are conducted (including pre-employment and random testing), DOT Physicals are obtained, and new drivers are required to go through 30 plus hours of training to ensure they are qualified and safe. </p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-2"></i> How can I apply to become a bus driver?</h3>
  <p class="faq-text">Contact Catherine Magers, and she will give you all of the proper information and requirements necessary to pursue employment with the HCPSS as a bus driver. You can reach her at: 410-313-6733.</p>
