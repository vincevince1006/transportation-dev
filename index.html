  <h2>Be Prepared for the Upcoming School Year</h2>
  <p>Families with younger children should practice walking to their assigned bus stops together and help their children memorize their route numbers. Parents could also write down their child's stop number on their folders or, if possible, sew it onto their backpack. Ensure that your child does not forget their route number.</p>
