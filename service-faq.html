<h2 id="stops">Bus Stops and School Departures</h2>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> The bus drives past my house. Why can’t it just stop at my house? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">Bus stops are placed to allow the buses easy access and egress through neighborhoods while keeping safety a priority. In addition, adding bus stops causes further delays on our bus routes and extends the students' ride time. In the end, this means that bus routes would have to start earlier in the morning to arrive at schools on time. Similarly, adding stops in the afternoon would cause students to arrive home later.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> How is a bus stop established?</h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">Bus stops are established by using several factors, which include walking conditions, walking distance to the stop and road accessibility.  Given acceptable walking conditions, bus stops are placed a minimum of 1/4 mile apart, and students may be required to walk up to .4 miles, without jeopardizing their safety. </p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> Can the bus stop change?</h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">Bus stops can change from year to year, based on the enrollment information the transportation service receives. Stops can also change due to safety concerns. If you have a question, call the transportation office at: 410-313-6726.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> My child is in the “Walk Zone,” but the walk to school is not safe. Who should I speak to about that?</h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">If you believe that the walk-zone is unsafe, express your concern to the Transportation Area Manager of that school. </p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> My child goes to a daycare service in the area. Can they still take the bus home? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">To qualify for bus transportation, the childcare provider’s address must be within the attendance area of the school and outside of the walking area for that school.  Parents must provide the school with the provider’s name, address, and phone number.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> Can my child ride a different bus home? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">Many HCPSS families often request changes, particularly for afternoon transportation, to accommodate child-care, after-school activities or other special needs. We can accommodate your request if there is space available on that bus. We cannot create a new bus stop on any route; therefore, your child will be assigned to an existing stop on that bus route that is closest to your requested destination. If you need to request a change in the normal routing for your student, please contact the school office before noon. As always, the Office of Pupil Transportation will do its best to meet your family's needs.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> What should I do if there is a custody situation that prohibits my child’s other parent from taking him/her?</h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">Please contact the school as soon as possible regarding any custody issues.  The school will, in turn, contact the Transportation Department to relay the information to the bus driver.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> Can my child board a different bus to go to a friend’s house?</h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">For your child to ride home with another student in the afternoon, a permission slip must be written, dated and signed by the parent or guardian and approved by school staff before the afternoon dismissal time. </p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> Can a family member/other adult board a school bus at the stop? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">No. The safety of the children is always our priority. And we encourage parents wishing to talk to their child’s bus driver to do so at school with an administrator. </p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> What happens once the bus gets to the school? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">Once the bus gets to school, the students disembark from the bus and enter into the school. </p>

<h2 id="delays">Delays</h2>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> My child’s bus is consistently late/delayed. Why is this? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">Every day, situations arise that are beyond our drivers' control. These can include traffic accidents, driver absences, maintenance problems, lane closings and roadwork, weather delays or even a late departure from school. Please be patient, as the drivers make every effort to stay on schedule while being mindful of student safety.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> What should I do if my child’s bus is more than 15 minutes late? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">We recommend that you contact your school to see if the bus was held at school or delayed. If the school staff members are unaware of any delay or departure, they contact the Office of Pupil Transportation and work with our staff to determine the cause.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> My child’s bus arrives earlier/later than we would like. Can the time be changed?</h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">All HCPSS buses operate on a comprehensive schedule that helps to ensure that the system operates safely and efficiently while working to deliver students to school safely and on time. Because of the number of students needing transportation, and to ensure effective scheduling, the overall bus schedules cannot be adjusted to accommodate an individual request.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> Does weather affect the bus schedule? If so, can I be notified about delays?</h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">Yes. Parents should monitor weather conditions during inclement weather and anticipate that school buses may run behind schedule. HCPSS will notify parents of weather closures and delays using our alert service, <a href="http://www.hcpss.org/hcpss-news/">HCPSS News</a>. Parents are automatically signed up for this service based on information from their emergency procdeure card or recent enrollment form.</p>

<h2>Operations</h2>
<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> Does the bus driver assign seats?</h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">The bus driver may assign seats as he/she feels necessary to maintain order and safety on the bus.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> Does HCPSS offer special services for children with disabilities? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">We provide specialized transportation to students with a disability in accordance with the child's Individualized Education Program (IEP). Occasionally, a student requires special transportation because of a temporary disability. Please contact your school principal to discuss your child's needs and to complete the appropriate forms to meet your student’s needs.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> How can I locate items that were lost on the bus? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">Drivers and substitute drivers check their buses after each run, and they usually keep left-behind items on the bus for a week. If not claimed by then, the items are then turned in to the Transportation Office or the school to which the bus is assigned. You may help by labeling all of your child’s belongings with the child’s name and school. Please check with your driver first for any lost items. If they no longer have the item, please contact your child’s school or the Transportation Department directly for assistance.</p>

<h3 class="faq-question"><i class="fa fa-angle-right fa-2"></i> My child missed the bus this afternoon. Is the bus able to come back to school? </h3>
  <p class="faq-text hide">At most schools, the drivers receive a signal from school staff when they can depart after a sufficient time has been allowed for students to exit the school to board the buses. Sometimes students are held up at school for unforeseen reasons and miss their school buses. Once buses depart the school, they are not able to return to pick up any students who have missed their buses.</p>
