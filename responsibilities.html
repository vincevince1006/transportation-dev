  <p>Parents, we need your help to further the safety of all students by making certain that your children know the bus rules and etiquette that help ensure orderly, safe, and enjoyable bus trips for everyone. Parents, also make sure that your children know their bus route number, located in windows on both the left and right side of the vehicle, near the front. The number that is painted on the bus, normally on the bumpers and body, is not used for bus route identification. For younger children (Elementary and Middle school age) we recommend that you or another trusted adult wait at the bus stop with the students to supervise their behavior and to help with any problems that may come up, such as a delayed bus or injury while waiting. Both adults and students should stand near the bus stop, not more than 150 feet away, where they can see the bus as it arrives. </p>

  <p>Bus stops are chosen to provide both safety and convenience to most students, and also to economize on time and fuel that students spend on the bus. Parents, please do not request bus drivers to make additional stops. This puts our drivers in a difficult position, as our regulations prohibit bus operators from making extra stops between the designated bus stops in place. Many bus routes are designed so that students do not need to cross a major roadway to use the bus. This is indicated on route descriptions (next to the bus stop notation) by “RSO,” which means Right Side Only.  Parents should never allow their students to bypass this safety measure by walking across the street to use a different bus stop. </p>

<p>Students are completely responsible for their behavior, attitude, and exercise of self-control while on the bus and at bus stops. Disorderly students could potentially harm all of the riders by distracting the bus driver, and even make it an intimidating experience for the other students. School buses are an extension of school, and therefore, students are expected to adhere to the same standards of behavior on a school bus as in the classroom. And just like students obey teachers and instructors while at school, so they are expected to obey the bus operators who are their instructors while on the way to and back from school. Remember, riding the school bus is a privilege for most students- but it is not a right. Therefore, it can and will be revoked if the student fails to observe the basic standards of conduct and safety required of them. </p>

<h3>Avoid the Danger Zone</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Take 10 giant steps away from the bus when getting off.</li>
    <li>Always cross in front of the bus.</li>
    <li>Look at the bus driver and wait for the driver’s signal before crossing the road.</li>
    <li>If you drop something outside the bus, leave it. Get permission from the driver before picking it up. Never go under the bus, the driver will help you.</li>
  </ul>
