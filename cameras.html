<p>In an effort to curb bullying and other inappropriate behavior on school buses, the Howard County Public School System is installing digital camera systems on nearly half of its school buses.</p>

<p>Camera recordings will not be monitored, and only will be accessed when HCPSS staff determine a recording is necessary to assist in an investigation. The ultimate goal is to outfit all 439 buses with camera systems within the next few years.</p>
